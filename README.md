Problem Definition
Sudoku Verifier:
Instance: An n 2 x n 2 Sudoku grid, filled with an arbitrary amount of numbers ∈ [1, n ], where n ∈ N ∖ {0}
Accept: if the Sudoku grid has a solution. A Sudoku grid is said to have a solution if for all rows, columns and nxn
sub-grids, the Sudoku grid contains each of the n possible numbers.
A typical Sudoku grid is 9x9 (or 3 2 x 3 2 ), but we have made our problem an nxn to allow for other sizes of
instances of the problem
